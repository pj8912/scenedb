The Movie Scene Database

Website : [scenedb,com](https://scenedb.com)


Finding specific movie scenes can be challenging due to the lack of precise timestamps and contextual details. Additionally, comprehensive scene-level metadata is often restricted within platforms. Thatâ€™s where [SceneDB](scenedb.com) comes in!  

I designed SceneDB to be straightforward and easy to navigate for users searching for movie scenes metadata. Anyone can upload the scene they like.  

Anyone can contribute by creating or editing scenes, each of which includes a title, summary, timestamp, screenshots, and more.  

Movie & Tv Show metadata is sourced from TMDB.
